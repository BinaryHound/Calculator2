# Calculator 
This is my calculator project. It's a simple project to learn, create, and explore.  The calculator's current state is a simple one. Add, Subtract, Divide, and Multiplication are all functioning if your input is any number.  

UPDATE 0.0.2:  
- Included a new Clear button to empty all collection containers, and clear all output labels. <br>  
- Included multi-input calculations of numbers greater than 1 input. <br>  
- Fixed some code duplication and created a new method for number dequeueing.<br>  
- Made Calculator output label write from a fixed length, instead of auto-resizing.<br>  
- Fixed division error.<br>  
- Fixed subtraction error.<br>  
- Fixed unnecessary stack push call.<br>   

Upcoming Changes 0.0.3: 
- Look for single delegate to clean up some of the programs clutter. 
- More functionality for college students (Notepad, Calculator, To do list, Calendar) all in one place.
- Optimizations once code is a bit further along.
- Look for new functions like sqrt(), log(), sin(), tan(), and cos().
- and many more!
